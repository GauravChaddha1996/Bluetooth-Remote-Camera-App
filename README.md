# Introduction
This project was developed as submission for an assignment for an internship post. The app lets you control the camera of another android device with the same app installed and paired by bluetooth. 

## Steps to use
1. Enable the bluetooth before opening the app in Android 6.0 and above.
2. Pair the two phones using the app. The device which starts the pairing process becomes the server and the other device becomes client.
3. You can now control the camera in the client device from server device.
4. You get the images that are snapped on the client device saved in server device gallery.
